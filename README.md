# Lasso-Ridge-SGD-and-Batch-Normalization-on-housing-dataset
The project aims to improve the accuracy of house price prediction using a housing dataset by applying advanced regularization and optimization techniques. Accurate prediction of house prices is crucial for various real estate applications, including property valuation and investment decision-making.

We implemented Lasso and Ridge regularization to introduce penalty terms to the linear regression model, encouraging sparse coefficients and reducing overfitting. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was employed as an optimization algorithm to efficiently train the models. Additionally, batch normalization was applied to normalize the input features, enhancing model stability and convergence.
